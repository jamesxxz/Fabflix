 Include how and where you use the LIKE/ILIKE predicate in your README.md:
In the buildInputQuery method in the movieservlet.java, we implement the LIKE pattern by appending wildcard characters (%) around the user-provided value, allowing partial matching of the input against the database fields (e.g., m.title LIKE '%value%' matches titles containing the input).
